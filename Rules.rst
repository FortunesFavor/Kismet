ATTRIBUTES
----------

Attributes are divided into the following categories:

BODY
  This attribute represents the physical condition your body is in, and will affect skills that test your Strength or Endurance
 
REACTION
  This attribute represents how quickly you are able to respond to things, and will affect skills that test your Agility, Dexterity, or Perceptions

  This attribute represents how well you are  able to reason and remember, and will affect skills that test your Intelligence and Knowledge
 
PERSONA 
  This attribute represents how well you present yourself, and will affect skills that test your Charisma and Demeanour 
 
SKILLS
------

 - Skills are talents that draw upon your Attributes, for example Firearms would require Reaction, while Brawling would require Body
 - There is no set list of skills, these are specializations that you create for yourself inspired by your background history

TRAITS
------

Traits are special abilities that your character has, which can be activated when in danger to give an Advantage. 

Some traits have an AP cost to activate or sustain, while others simply add features to your character

General Price Guide:

Cosmetic Feature granting Skill Boost - [Boost] x TP (Example: Cat-eyes giving +2 to Perception)

Cosmetic Feature granting Ability - [2-5] x TP depending on Ability (Example: Thermal Vision)

Natural Weapons - [Weapon Rating] x TP

Talent costing X AP to activate or maintain - X TP   (Example: Winged Flight costing 10AP per turn to use = 10 TP)

 - Healthy    - You have no wounds
 - Injured    - You have sustained an injury and will not recover AP until rested
 - Wounded    - You have sustained a serious wound and will not recover AP until healed
 - Unconcious - You have lost consciousness and will need to be dragged to safty
 
 The amount of damage required to move from one Health Status to the next is determined by the BODY Attribute

Armor offers extra protection by extending how much damage you can take before moving to the next Health Status

==============================================================================================================================
							ADVANTAGE
==============================================================================================================================

It is possible to exploit details of scenes to obtain an advantage over an enemy or trap. These advantages manifest themselves in the form of bonus dice, where the best score is taken. 

==============================================================================================================================
							ASPECTS
==============================================================================================================================

Aspects are used to gain advantages in situations, especially when dealing with familiar challenges or on home turf.  

When you believe an aspect you have is relevant to play, suggest to the Storyteller that you'd like to invoke it to gain an extra dice on your roll. 

The Background Aspects for Character Creation are listed below. Additional aspects can be gained at a later date through training or experience.

= CHARACTER CONCEPT
This aspect is intended to be a short 2-5 word description of what someone would describe your character as
	 [Example: "Alien Mechanic" or "Corporate Private Investigator"]

= AMBITION ASPECT
This aspect is for describing what your characters life goal is, what keeps them motivated. 
	[Example: "A fistful of dollars" or "Crush the Competition!"
       
= BACKGROUND ASPECT
This aspect describes what the character had been doing with their life up to the beginning of the adventure in as few words as possible. 
	[Example:  "Crew of UECF Harmony" or "Graduate of Lakeview Psionics Academy"
		
= CONVICTION ASPECT
What is your life motto or creed, what best describes your way of thinking?  
	[Example: "For the right price..." or "I kneel to no one"]

= DILEMMA ASPECT
Just as you have a moral conviction, you must also have a moral failure. This aspect best describes a personality trait that you'd rather hide from others. 
	[Example: "Thrill of the Kill" or "Living a lie"] 

= EXCEPTIONAL SKILL ASPECT
This aspect describes your best quality, the skill you could perform blind folded. You get two extra dice when tapping this aspect with your skill. 
	[Example: "Ace Pilot" or "Top marks in Academy"]

= FOE ASPECT      
You've met some people  in your life, and not all of them have liked you. This aspect describes a specific faction that is out to harm you. 
	[Example: "Wanted on 15 systems" or "Escaped my Master"]
           
= GEAR ASPECT            
This is your signature piece, the sidearm or piece of kit that never leaves your side. You'd lose sleep if you ever lost it. This aspect grants an extra dice in conjunction with the gear's bonus when either making an attack with it, or when making a skill check. 
	[Example: "Dad's old revolver" or "The good wrench"] 
   
= HELP ASPECT                
Not everyone you've met has tried to kill you, some of them actually liked you. This aspect is for granting an extra dice when dealing with a faction that's friendly to you. 
	[Example: "Us pilots stick together" or "[Name] has my back"]

= INFERIOR SKILL ASPECT  
There's things you're just not good at, and you know it. This aspect describes something you're knowingly bad at. While you'll still get your second dice roll for invoking this aspect, you'll take the lower of the two rolls. 
	[Example: "I don't numbers good"]
